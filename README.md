This is an attempt at implementing [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) in the D Programming Language.
Rx.d allows the composition of powerful Observable sequences with familiar patterns.

The API is based largely on the Rx.NET API with some minor changes.  Efforts are made to maintain
compatibility with the ReactiveX spec.
